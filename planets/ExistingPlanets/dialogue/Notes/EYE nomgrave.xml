      <Page>One of the Nomai that survived aboard the Deep Storm Station constructed a superweapon composed of gravity crystals, inspired by the comet that had annihilated their clan.</Page>
      <Page>Fueled by rage and grief, they were intent on firing the weapon towards the source of the Interloper in an act of vengeance - before news of the early Hearthians becoming endangered by ghost matter spurred a decision to use it for good instead.</Page>
      <Page>Using the Inspired's artificial gravity, they siphoned as much ghost matter as they safely could from the star system to ensure that the Hearthians would not grow up in a world consumed by deadly matter.</Page>
      <Page>Upon discovering that the Hearthians were playing in the mining site of Timber Hearth and becoming exposed to the ghost matter within, beyond the reach of the Inspired, the Nomai decided to seal the mining site permanently.</Page>
