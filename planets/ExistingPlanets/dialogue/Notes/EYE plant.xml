      <Page>The superweapon constructed by one of the surviving Nomai was delivered to, and contained within Dark Bramble - where they hoped ghost matter would be safely absorbed and neutralized by the bramble over time.</Page>
      <Page>As it travelled into Dark Bramble, the superweapon's payload of ghost matter would protect it from - and inevitably, kill many anglerfishes as it travelled.</Page>
      <Page>This culled the overpopulation of anglerfishes that made exploring the Dark Bramble impossible in the Nomai's time, and would clear the path for a Hearthian to reach the Nomai clan's derelict vessel millennia later.</Page>
