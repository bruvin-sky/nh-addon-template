			<Page>This! It's some kind of Nomai slab. I dropped my flute by accident this loop and noticed it floating by, carried by the waves.</Page>
			<Page>Who knows how long it's been on its little voyage? I bet it still works too - all the lil' pieces of Nomai tech we've found are hardy as nails and perfectly functioning. Makes me wish whoever made them made our ships!</Page>
			<Page>I can’t do anything with it other than stone skipping. Since you’re the one with the translator tool actually interested in figuring out stuff, you should really have it.</Page>
			<Page>But hey. You could use a little break from adventuring all over the star system, looking for clues and getting fried by the sun over and over, don't you think?</Page>

				<Page>I'll hide the stone <![CDATA[<color=orange>somewhere on this island</color>]]>, and you gotta find it before the end of this loop to win.</Page>
				<Page>You win, you keep it! I'll be extra diligent to catch it every loop for you to try again either way.</Page>
				<Page>But games need some stakes to be fun, right? If you can't find it in time, you'll need to carry out a lil' penalty before I let you try again.</Page>
				<Page>Don't worry, I won't tell you to go get eaten by an anglerfish or anything mean.</Page>
				<Page>You'll just have to visit the observatory in the village, and tell Hornfels I'm the most hardworking astronaut in the space program. <![CDATA[<Pause/>]]> With a straight face.</Page>
				<Page>And I’ll know if you have! ‘Cause they’ll radio me <![CDATA[<i>]]>so fast<![CDATA[</i>]]> to freak out about their newest astronaut going nuts, heh.</Page>

				<Page>Cool, cool. Oh, I thought of another small penalty that should be easier on your pride if ya need to try again after this loop.</Page>
				<Page>You know my dear ship? Floating around out somewhere on the oceans?</Page>
				<Page>Truth is, I smashed an antenna while landing, many, many loops ago, right before this whole time-loop business started. And uh, didn't think it was important to fix it at the time..</Page>
				<Page>Ever wonder why I've got no idea where the poor thing is these days? <![CDATA[<Pause/>]]> Now you know, ha.</Page>
				<Page>You just gotta fix up the antenna so it starts transmitting its location to my helmet again - so after a relative millennia, I'll finally see where it is on my visor feed again. <![CDATA[<Pause/>]]> Well, for all of one loop, at least.</Page>
				<Page>You cool with that? Just something small to do if you lose again this loop.</Page>

				<Page>Woah, did you fix the antenna on my ship? I can finally see where it is on my visor again! Stars above!</Page>

				<Page>Cool, cool- wait, I just remembered.. You already fixed my ship's antenna! That was actually the penalty I had in mind if you lost again this game. Kinda redundant to make you go do it again.</Page>
				<Page>Hey, whatever! I'll give you the third "penalty" I had in mind then. It's.. more of a suggestion - you can do it while playing the game and looking for the stone. Up to you.</Page>
				<Page>You just gotta take a picture of me with your ol' scout - y'know, when a cyclone picks the island up and I start floating up all cool in space!</Page>
				<Page>This should be good.. Alright, close your eyes!</Page>

			<Page>Hey, you ready to play again? I got another idea. This isn't as much a penalty as a.. request, heh.</Page>
			<Page>Couldja just take a lil photo of me with your scout, once a cyclone picks up the island and I start floating off all cool?</Page>
			<Page>Up to you. It's just a fun little.. idea I had. Let's just start! I'm all outta penalties.. well, unless you're one of those Hearthians that hate burnt mallows.</Page>
