			<Page>So it’s launch day, huh? Hal’s going to miss you.</Page>
			<Page>Speaking of launch day... I was thinking about it, and the platform those ships launch from is getting old. Isn’t it about time you built a new, less flammable one?</Page>
			<Page>That big tree in the village would be the perfect choice. I wouldn’t mind helping out the space program. Just say the word!</Page>

			<Page>Woah. For real?</Page>
			<Page>Wait, isn't the bramble that horrible plant that destroyed a whole planet in the star system? Chert once told me about it around the campfire.</Page>
			<Page>Isn't one of its seeds being here really, <![CDATA[<i>]]>really<![CDATA[</i>]]> bad news?</Page>
			<Page>Hrm.</Page>
			<Page>Hey, me and Hal'll take care of this little business quick-like in no time. Don't worry about it, and enjoy your launch! Promise this place'll still be in one piece by the time you get back.</Page>
			<Page>Worst case? Heh. <![CDATA[<Pause>]]>This bramble seed's gonna learn real quick that no tree - or <![CDATA[<i>]]>plant<![CDATA[</i>]]> - is safe from burning up on Timber Hearth.</Page>
