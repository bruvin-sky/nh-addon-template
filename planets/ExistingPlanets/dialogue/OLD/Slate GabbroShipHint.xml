      <Page>Uh.. no? Smoke get to your head or something? I wanted to ask you to check in on Gabbro's ship sometime.</Page>
      <Page>I'm pretty certain their ship's antenna is busted or something, because its position ain't registering on our radars. And uh, I shouldn't have to say this, but it's a problem if those expensive hunks of alloys and wood just fly off into the void.</Page>
      <Page>I radioed Gabbro and told them to go repair it, but from the sound of it I'm pretty certain their ship ain't even on the same island they're on anymore. And I know better than asking them to swim out and look for it.</Page>
      <Page>So uh, just fly around Giant's Deep sometime and look for it, will ya? Repair it if you can. I just need to know it hasn't exploded yet. Thanks!</Page>
