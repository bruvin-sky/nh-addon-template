			<Page>But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.</Page>
			<Page>I mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful.</Page>
			<Page>Truth be told, I'm just trying to find the best spot to nap in the star system. So far, this planet has not swept me off my feet, ironically.</Page>
			<Page>I get woken up every time I start to nod off by a big roaring cyclone. 's why I just gave up and started playing my flute and meditating instead.</Page>

			<Page>What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the <![CDATA[<i>]]>island<![CDATA[</i>]]> where I found the glowing Nomai <![CDATA[<i>]]>statue<![CDATA[</i>]]>.<![CDATA[<Pause>]]> ...Get it?</Page>
			<Page>I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale.</Page>
			<Page>If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see.</Page>

			<Page>There’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.</Page>
			<Page>As for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach.</Page>

			<Page>You’re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through.</Page>

			<Page>Hey, you're back! Sorry bud, looks like you lost..</Page>
			<Page>That means you gotta do the penalty before you can try again. You remember the one I mentioned?</Page>
			<Page>Go tell Hornfels in the museum back on Timber Hearth what you think of me! In very impressive words.</Page>
			<Page>Swear I'm not on an ego trip - I just think it'd be funny to see what they'd think of their newest astronaut suddenly thinking so highly of me.</Page>

			<Page>What's up? I still haven't heard from Hornfels. Didja talk to them yet?</Page>
			<Page>C'mon, don't worry about ruining your reputation as an astronaut back home. They'll forget any trace of it next loop!</Page>
			<Page>You can't imagine how many times I've just radioed back home to say something completely nuts for fun, knowing they won't remember. It's pretty socially liberating!</Page>

				<Page>Cool, cool. Oh, I thought of another small penalty that should be easier on your pride if ya need to try again after this loop.</Page>
				<Page>You know my dear ship? Floating around out somewhere on the oceans?</Page>
				<Page>Truth is, I smashed an antenna while landing, many, many loops ago, right before this whole time-loop business started. And uh, didn't think it was important to fix it at the time..</Page>
				<Page>Ever wonder why I've got no idea where the poor thing is these days? <![CDATA[<Pause/>]]> Now you know, ha.</Page>
				<Page>You just gotta fix up the antenna so it starts transmitting its location to my helmet again - so after a relative millennia, I'll finally see where it is on my visor feed again. <![CDATA[<Pause/>]]> Well, for all of one loop, at least.</Page>
				<Page>You cool with that? Just something small to do if you lose again this loop.</Page>
				<Page>Alright - close your eyes!</Page>

				<Page>Woah, did you fix the antenna on my ship? I can finally see where it is on my visor again! Stars above!</Page>
				<Page>Sending you to fix that was honestly the only other good penalty I had in mind if you lost the game. That and maybe getting you to eat a burnt marshmallow. But that's the best way to eat them, so that wouldn't count.</Page>

				<Page>Cool, cool- wait, I just remembered.. You already fixed my ship's antenna! That was actually the penalty I had in mind if you lost again this game. Kinda redundant to make you go do it again.</Page>
				<Page>Hey, whatever! I'll give you the third "penalty" I had in mind then. It's.. more of a suggestion - you can do it while playing the game and looking for the stone. Up to you.</Page>
				<Page>You just gotta take a picture of me with your ol' scout - y'know, when a cyclone picks the island up and I start floating up all cool in space!</Page>
				<Page>This should be good.. Alright, close your eyes!</Page>

			<Page>Dang, I'm good at this, huh? Sorry I'm making you take a longer break than you probably anticipated from adventuring, time buddy.</Page>
			<Page>But rules are rules! Gotta do that penalty before you can try again. It's an easy one, just go fix up the antenna on my ship!</Page>

			<Page>Man, it feels good to at least know where that old ship is. To restock on my marshmallows I mean, not actual transport.</Page>
			<Page>Hey, you ready to play again? I got another idea. This isn't as much a penalty as a.. request, heh.</Page>
			<Page>Couldja just take a lil photo of me with your scout, once a cyclone picks up the island and I start floating off all cool?</Page>
			<Page>Up to you. It's just a fun little.. idea I had. Let's just start! I'm all outta penalties.. well, unless you're one of those Hearthians that hate burnt mallows.</Page>
			<Page>One last time, hopefully - close your eyes!</Page>
