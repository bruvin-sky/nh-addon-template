			<Page>Oh, just a friendly reminder... <![CDATA[<i>Don't..</i>]]> <![CDATA[<Pause/>]]> let me catch you ramming your new ship into the locked Nomai door.</Page>
			<Page>Tektite told me there was a dent on the door in the large geyser mountain. I'm not sure who it was - but someone rammed their ship into the door trying to break it down again. To no avail, I should note.</Page>
			<Page>I radioed everyone off-planet with a ship, but naturally, all of 'em said they had nothin' to do with it. But I can't really take their word at face level without getting a look at their ships myself.</Page>
			<Page>Actually.. While you're out there, you mind checking up on each of the travelers, see how their ships are looking? It'll be a good way to get your space legs under you.</Page>
			<Page>Look out for damage on the ship's cockpit, specifically.</Page>
			<Page>Whoever it was, I'm sure Gneiss would love to have either drums, a flute, or a banjo back on the orchestra while they spend some time <![CDATA[<i>grounded from spaceflight.</i>]]></Page>
