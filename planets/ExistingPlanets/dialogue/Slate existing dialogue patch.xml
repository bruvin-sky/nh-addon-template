			<Page>Stars, <![CDATA[<i>I don't know!</i>]]> I'm just roasting marshmallows and relaxing here. They're hatchlings, they might have clambered into your ship somehow for all I know.</Page>
			<Page>Mica's probably still fiddling with the model rocket.</Page>
			<Page>They told me they had something to ask you they couldn't tell me for whatever reason.. So it's probably plans to steal my job or something.</Page>
				<Page>Tephra and Galena should be playing in the village somewhere.</Page>
				<Page>I saw 'em trekking outside the village recently for whatever reason, though - so don't take my word on that.</Page>
				<Page>Arkose's probably still throwing rocks into the patch of ghost matter at the top of the village.</Page>
				<Page>Still uh.. no idea why they do that all day.</Page>
					<Page>And Moraine's probably stargazing on the big tree in the village, making sure Marl doesn't chop it down.</Page>
					<Page>I wonder if that Marl'll ever let go of that grudge.</Page>
					<Page>No good in holding a grudge against a tree, you know?</Page>
						<Page>That's all I know. Just get a move on - you'll probably just find all of 'em on the way up to the observatory for those launch codes, anyway!</Page>

"My ship’s reactor went critical and I died in the resulting explosion."

			<Page>Ugh, I get that nightmare, too.</Page>
			<Page>Where you die, I mean. You’re not exactly a rocket scientist, you know? Me, I could fix a reactor gone critical in my sleep.</Page>
			<Page>If your ship reactor’s cooked, best thing <![CDATA[<i>]]>you<![CDATA[</i>]]> can do is to put as much distance as you can between you and the ship.</Page>

"I ran out of oxygen and suffocated."

		<Name>SuffocatedDeath</Name>

			<Page>Haha, that’s a classic!</Page>
			<Page>Don’t worry about it too much — I don’t know an Outer Wilds Ventures member who <![CDATA[<i>]]>hasn’t<![CDATA[</i>]]> had that dream.</Page>
			<Page>But listen, as long as you keep an eye on your suit’s oxygen levels and remember to refill it inside your ship or wherever you find trees, you’ll be fine.</Page>
			<Page>Gossan’s still sore that the jetpack can run on oxygen once it’s out of fuel, but hey, it hasn’t killed anyone yet.</Page>

"I got crushed to death on the Hourglass Twins."
	<DialogueNode>
		<Name>CrushedDeath</Name>
		<Dialogue>
			<Page>Yeesh, that’s a gnarly dream to have right before a first launch.</Page>
			<Page>You’ll want to stay out of the Hourglass Twins’ sand stream, for sure. And watch out for rising sand levels whenever you’re inside a cave.</Page>
			<Page>Still, Chert hasn’t managed to get buried alive out there. And they’re <![CDATA[<i>]]>tiny<![CDATA[</i>]]>.</Page>
