		PHLOX: I love it! The Sunless City is so cool, and I made so many friends - they taught me how to play the fossil fish game, and I showed them how to make sand dwellings!

		<Text>
		PHLOX: But papa, I was too shy to ask any of the Nomai that live here.. Why do the Nomai on Ember Twin call their city the "Sunless" City? Does Ash Twin hide away the sun from Ember Twin a lot?

		PLUME: At the same time, it is also true that the Ash Twin regularly eclipses the sun as it orbits its twin - so I suppose the Sunless City could fit <![CDATA[<color=orange>both interpretations</color>]]> of its name!
