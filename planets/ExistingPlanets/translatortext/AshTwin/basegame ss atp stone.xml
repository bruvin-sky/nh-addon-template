		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<LocationA/>
		<Text>PYE: It fired, Yarrow. But it failed. The <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>sun</color>]]> barely responded; there were infintestimally small surface-level changes, but they were barely visible, even to the third eye.</Text>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<LocationA/>
		<Text>PYE: The <![CDATA[<color=orange>Sun Station</color>]]> is useless. It will never, and <![CDATA[<i>could</i>]]> never, cause the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>sun</color>]]> to explode.</Text>

		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>

		<Text>PYE: I don’t know what comes next, my friends. I suppose we must start over, but I’m unsure how to start over.</Text>

		<ID>5</ID>
		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<LocationB/>
		<Text>YARROW: Return to <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>]]> first, my friend. Perhaps a change of task would help: Spire noticed a comet approaching this star system that we’d like to investigate.</Text>

		<ID>6</ID>
		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<LocationB/>
		<Text>YARROW: Pye... I hurt for you, my friends; we all know how hard you’ve both worked. I can only offer my compassion. How are you? How is Idaea?</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>7</ID>
		<ParentID>6</ParentID>
		<LocationA/>
		<Text>IDAEA: We’re well, Yarrow (or as well as can be expected, given the circumstances), though disappointed. I may have disagreed with exploding the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>sun</color>]]>, but I never wished the device would fail. I’d hoped our terrible work was finished.</Text>
