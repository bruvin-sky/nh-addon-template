		FILIX: Friends, the <![CDATA[<color=orange>storm lantern</color>]]> is now functioning. This device will forecast incoming meteor storms and impacts for our safety! (My gratitude for building this platform to catch my equipment as I worked, Plume!)

		FILIX: The <![CDATA[<color=orange>storm lantern</color>]]> has been built into the roof of the crust to maximize its visbility; Keep it in your sights, and seek immediate shelter should you see its red light illuminating the settlement!

			PLUME: What a marvellous invention, Filix. How does this device function? Does it detect changes in the atmospheric temperature as a meteor enters and heats the atmosphere?

			FILIX: No, it is much simpler than that! As the volcanic moon orbits overhead the settlement, the device's sensor is <![CDATA[<color=orange>pulled upward by the moon's gravity,</color>]]> emitting a red light as it reaches its apex.

			THATCH: Taking advantage of the moon's gravitational pull as it orbits the planet... How ingenius, Filix! Now, we shall be able to <![CDATA[<color=orange>track the volcanic moon's approach,</color>]]> even when hiding undercrust!

			KOUSA: Filix, could a meteor impact have caused the <![CDATA[<color=orange>storm lantern</color>]]> to become unwell? It appears to be behaving rather aberrantly from the volcanic moon's usual duration of orbit..

			FILIX: I have checked, but the device is well. Could <![CDATA[<color=orange>another body</color>]]> (such as that massive ocean planet) be exerting its forces on the device's sensors?

			KOUSA: I do not believe so - the ocean planet is nowhere near this planet at this time. And the storm lantern appears to have returned to the volcanic moon's usual duration of orbit again... How mysterious.
