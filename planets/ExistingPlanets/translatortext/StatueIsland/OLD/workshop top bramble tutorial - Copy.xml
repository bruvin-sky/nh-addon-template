		DAZ: I believe you are using a voyager stone to <![CDATA[<color=orange>the submerged plane of Bramble Island,</color>]]> my love! That is why the vessel is being dissolved instantly on connection. Try the other stone instead!

		DAZ: An update: I checked the storm shelters on the island, and they appeared to be functioning normally now. I imagine they were simply <![CDATA[<color=orange>attempting to activate as the sun orbited directly overhead!</color>]]>

		DAZ: If you visit the island now, you'll see the <![CDATA[<color=orange>solar tide</color>]]> from the sun washing higher on the island's shores. The light from the sun must be barely reaching the solar panel, causing the storm shelters to flicker!
