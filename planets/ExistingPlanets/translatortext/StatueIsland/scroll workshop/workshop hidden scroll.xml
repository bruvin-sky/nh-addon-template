		DAZ: Daz, I've been trying to access a conversation I wrote on this projection stone the other day, but this projection stone seems to lack any record of that conversation! Could there be an issue with the data stored on it?
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

		<Text>
		DAZ: I fear you may have misundersood how projection stones and recorded conversations work, my friend!

		<Text>
		DAZ: You see, conversations shared across projection stones are recorded into the projection walls they are written on, not the projection stones themselves.
		</Text>

		<Text>
		DAZ: A single projection stone only grants access to any conversation with its connected wall; Think of each projection stone as a unique key, and the projection walls you slot them into as locks for each key.

		<Text>
		DAZ: To give an example, you could only see this conversation by using a projection stone to ___ in my workshop's projection wall - or a projection stone to my workshop in yours, and no others!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

		<Text>
		DAZ: Goodness, that makes so much more sense now... No wonder I could never seem to find my conversations on a different wall I'd written it on! Thank you, Daz.
