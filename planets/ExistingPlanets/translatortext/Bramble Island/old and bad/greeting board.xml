		DAZ: Take caution as you walk on the ice, my love. Here it is: another <![CDATA[<color=orange>orcnid</color>]]> has become entrapped in this tangle of bramble vines after visiting the surface.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>2</ID>

		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>
		CASSAVA: Thank goodness you were able to spot its distress in time! Now, do I recall you mentioning <![CDATA[<color=orange>a new invention</color>]]> that might make our task of freeing it less treacherous?
		</Text>

		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<Text>
		DAZ: Indeed! While in this state, the orcnid's apphendages fold in an unfavorable position that proves impossible to safely approach. My new invention should insulate this danger! I am eager to show it to you in my <![CDATA[<color=orange>workshop,</color>]]> my love!

		<Text>
		DAZ: But the orcnid will waste no time slipping back under the current after being released.. Before we release it, I would like to quickly inspect its interior cavity for stowaways; I have found <![CDATA[<color=orange>scrolls</color>]]> lodged inside these poor creatures before.

		<Text>
		CASSAVA: I must remind the others to keep their scrolls and stones well-kept so they will not be swept away into the waves by the cyclones... Both for the orcnids' safety, and as a sign of respect to your craft!
