		DAZ: I'm fine, Cassava! I was simply disconnected from my voyager. I am currently trying to voyage to <![CDATA[<color=orange>Lovers' Cove's</color>]]> projection pool again, but I seem unable to..

		DAZ: That explains it. The tides caused by the sun's gravity as it orbits over the island must be washing high enough on the island to submerge the projection pool, dissolving my voyager.

		CASSAVA: I see.. Well, it's not a large issue, thankfully! We'll simply need to keep those tides in mind whenever we voyage to Giant's Deep.

		DAZ: It <![CDATA[<i>is</i>]]> an issue! That means it'll be inconvenient to use voyager stones to work here on Giant's Deep remotely.. My plan is in shambles!
