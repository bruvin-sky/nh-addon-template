		POKE: After the test, we will be able to study how conducting such vast quantities of energy may affect both warp cores, allowing us to better refine and improve the advanced warp core we are crafting for the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Ash Twin Project.</color>]]>

		CASSAVA: My deepest gratitude for your hard work, Poke. After the test is complete, could we perhaps.. repurpose these warp cores for building the warp pads connecting Giant's Deep to Ash Twin?
