Daz: Please update us as soon as you can - how did the test go, Yarrow?
Yarrow: Everything went as planned, Daz. Using the electric core of Giant’s Deep, the Deep Storm Station powered a 22-second loop, and an order from the Ash Twin Project for the Orbital Probe Cannon to fire was sent back in time.
Yarrow: However, after 20 billion loops of its 22-second flight, the probe began to repeat redundant trajectories - alerting the Ash Twin Project to trigger the memory statues to sync with you, as well as Privet, who alerted me to shut the project down.
Yarrow: While initially discouraging - this was well within our expectations, based on calculations made by the Southern Observatory to find the farthest possible orbit of the Eye. And more importantly, the Deep Storm Station still succeeded in its own goal.
Yarrow: Thanks to it, we can now be certain all mechanics of the Ash Twin Project’s time-loop are theoretically sound - and be confident to operate it without fear of endangering the star system and our clan, once the Sun Station is completed and able to power a full 22-minute loop.
///// Yarrow: I feel that with this success, we can finally assuage the unrest and conflict of morals which many of us have been festering inside since the conception of this project… myself included.
Cassava: Wait a moment.. So Daz was synced to that memory statue in Lover’s Cove? I still don’t quite follow this path of thought.
Daz: I.. I was afraid of the infinitesimally small possibility that you might turn me down, love. So I.. wanted to just see 22 seconds into the future of my proposal…
Cassava: Daz… You know you mean the world to me. You worry too much. But in hindsight, this is amazing: we had a time-traveling marriage! How many in existence could lay claim to that?!
Daz: My love! We’re engaged! We’re engaged!
Yarrow: Spare me your gelatinous behavior, you two! But truly, I am happy for you both. I wish you nothing but happiness in your future partnership!
Cassava: You have until the Ash Twin Project is ready to craft an even grander marriage proposal to Clary, Yarrow!
Yarrow: We’re nowhere ready for that!!
