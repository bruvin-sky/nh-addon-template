			CASSAVA: The tentacled species should be safe so long as they do not surface, but the native life of Timber Hearth.. They are being decimated... The geysers in the pools they dwell erupt and launch them out of the safety of the water.. And they travel onto land in search of food, perhaps even the Nomai they had grown accustomed to... They are dying in droves.
